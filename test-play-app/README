README
=================================

Dev Installation
----------------------
- get code from git
- run 'activator' command. Then run 'compile', then 'testOnly unit.*', then 'run' in console
- for integration tests to pass you need Postgres installed, running and with plank user configured (see Python code readme).


Unit Testing
----------------------
Unit tests are broken up in to Integration (slower) and Unit package.
to run only one of those categories, use the following in Play console (note, case sensitivity):
[plank-play-app] $ testOnly unit.*
[plank-play-app] $ testOnly integration.*


Build
----------------------
! Important. If you are adding dependencies into build.sbt file, then console need to be restarted (rerun activator executable) to cause loading of drivers.


Evolutions
----------------------
Use them for usersdb and for vendors-shard1. the other oltp shards will have to be managed manualy
